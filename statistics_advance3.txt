**Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.**

- **Estimation Statistics:** Estimation is the process of using sample data to make inferences about unknown population parameters. It involves providing estimates, or best guesses, of the values of population parameters.

- **Point Estimate:** A single value used to estimate the unknown population parameter. For example, the sample mean (\(\bar{x}\)) is a point estimate of the population mean (\(\mu\)).

- **Interval Estimate:** A range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. It includes a margin of error. For example, a confidence interval is an interval estimate.

**Q2. Write a Python function to estimate the population mean using a sample mean and standard deviation.**

```python
import scipy.stats as stats
import math

def confidence_interval(sample_mean, sample_std, sample_size, confidence_level):
    margin_of_error = stats.t.ppf((1 + confidence_level) / 2, df=sample_size - 1) * (sample_std / math.sqrt(sample_size))
    lower_bound = sample_mean - margin_of_error
    upper_bound = sample_mean + margin_of_error
    return lower_bound, upper_bound

# Example usage:
sample_mean = 500
sample_std = 50
sample_size = 50
confidence_level = 0.95

interval = confidence_interval(sample_mean, sample_std, sample_size, confidence_level)
print(f"95% Confidence Interval: {interval}")
```

**Q3: What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.**

- **Hypothesis Testing:** Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population parameter based on a sample of data. It involves formulating a hypothesis, collecting and analyzing data, and drawing conclusions about the population.

- **Importance:** Hypothesis testing is crucial in scientific research and decision-making. It allows researchers to test whether their assumptions or beliefs about a population parameter are supported by the sample data. It helps make informed decisions and draw valid conclusions.

**Q4: Create a hypothesis that states whether the average weight of male college students is greater than the average weight of female college students.**

- **Hypothesis:**
  - Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)): The average weight of male college students is equal to or less than the average weight of female college students.
  - Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\)): The average weight of male college students is greater than the average weight of female college students.

**Q5: Write a Python script to conduct a hypothesis test on the difference between two population means, given a sample from each population.**

```python
import scipy.stats as stats

def two_sample_t_test(sample1, sample2):
    stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(sample1, sample2)
    return stat, p_value

# Example usage:
sample_male = [72, 68, 75, 70, 78]
sample_female = [65, 62, 68, 70, 72]

statistic, p_value = two_sample_t_test(sample_male, sample_female)
print(f"Test Statistic: {statistic}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")
```

**Q6: What is a null and alternative hypothesis? Give some examples.**

- **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)):** A statement that there is no significant difference or effect, often a default assumption. It is what researchers aim to test against.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\)):** A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, indicating a significant difference or effect.

  **Examples:**
  1. \(H_0\): The mean exam scores are equal. \(H_1\): The mean exam scores are not equal.
  2. \(H_0\): The new drug has no effect. \(H_1\): The new drug has a significant effect.

**Q7: Write down the steps involved in hypothesis testing.**

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:** Clearly state the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. **Choose Significance Level (\(\alpha\)):** Select the level of significance to determine the cutoff for rejecting the null hypothesis.
3. **Collect Data:** Obtain a sample and collect relevant data.
4. **Conduct Test:** Use a statistical test to analyze the data and calculate the test statistic.
5. **Make Decision:** Compare the p-value to \(\alpha\) and decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
6. **Draw Conclusion:** Based on the decision, draw a conclusion about the population parameter.

**Q8. Define p-value and explain its significance in hypothesis testing.**

- **P-value:** The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

- **Significance:** A small p-value (typically less than the chosen significance level, \(\alpha\)) suggests that the observed data is unlikely under the assumption of the null hypothesis. Therefore, a small p-value leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

**Q9. Generate a Student's t-distribution plot using Python's matplotlib library, with the degrees of freedom parameter set to 10.**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

degrees_of_freedom = 10
x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 1000)
y = stats.t.pdf(x, df=degrees_of_freedom)

plt.plot(x, y, label=f't-Distribution (df={degrees_of_freedom})')
plt.title('Student\'s t-Distribution')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Q10. Write a Python program to calculate the two-sample t-test for independent samples, given two random samples of equal size and a null hypothesis that the population means are equal.**

```python
import scipy.stats as stats

def two_sample_t_test(sample1, sample2):
    stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(sample1, sample2)
    return stat, p_value

# Example usage:
sample1 = [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]
sample2 = [22, 28, 32, 38, 42]

statistic, p_value = two_sample_t_test(sample1, sample2)
print(f"Test Statistic: {statistic}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")
```

**Q11: What is Studentâ€™s t distribution? When to use the t-Distribution.**

- **Student's t-Distribution:** A probability distribution used in hypothesis testing when the sample size is small or when the population standard deviation is unknown.

- **When to Use:** Use the t-distribution when:
  - The sample size is small.
  - The population standard deviation is unknown.
  - The data is approximately normally distributed.

**Q12: What is t-statistic? State the formula for t-statistic.**

- **t-Statistic:** A measure used in hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.

- **Formula:** \(t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x
