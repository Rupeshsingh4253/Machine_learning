    "Q1. Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection by identifying and prioritizing relevant features that\n",
    "contribute to distinguishing between normal and anomalous instances. By selecting informative features and discarding\n",
    "irrelevant or redundant ones, feature selection helps improve the performance of anomaly detection algorithms by reducing \n",
    "noise, improving model interpretability, and enhancing computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Common evaluation metrics for anomaly detection algorithms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision and recall: Precision measures the proportion of correctly identified anomalies among all instances flagged as \n",
    "    anomalies, while recall measures the proportion of correctly identified anomalies among all true anomalies.\n",
    "- F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of an algorithm's performance.\n",
    "- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve: Plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate\n",
    "    (1-specificity) for varying thresholds, allowing the trade-off between true positives and false positives to be visualized.\n",
    "- Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC): Quantifies the overall performance of an anomaly detection algorithm by calculating the \n",
    "    area under the ROC curve, with a higher AUC-ROC indicating better discrimination between anomalies and normal instances.\n",

    "Q3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm used for\n",
    "partitioning a dataset into clusters of varying shapes and sizes. It works by grouping together closely packed data points\n",
    "based on their density within a specified radius (epsilon) and minimum number of points (minPts) required to form a dense\n",
    "region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The epsilon parameter in DBSCAN determines the radius within which neighboring points are considered to be part of the \n",
    "same cluster. A smaller epsilon value results in tighter clusters, potentially leading to the merging of multiple clusters into \n",
    "a single larger cluster. Conversely, a larger epsilon value may result in more sparse clusters and may overlook smaller, \n",
    "densely packed clusters or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In DBSCAN, the core points are data points that have at least minPts neighbors within a distance of epsilon, forming the\n",
    "dense core of a cluster. Border points have fewer than minPts neighbors but are within epsilon distance of a core point and are\n",
    "considered part of the cluster's boundary. Noise points, or outliers, do not belong to any cluster because they fail to meet\n",
    "the criteria for core or border points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. DBSCAN detects anomalies by identifying data points that do not belong to any cluster, classifying them as noise points.\n",
    "The key parameters involved in the process are epsilon (radius of the neighborhood) and minPts (minimum number of points\n",

    "Data points that are not part of any dense region or cluster are considered anomalies.\n",

    "Q7. The make_circles package in scikit-learn is used to generate synthetic datasets consisting of concentric circles, with each\n",
    "circle representing a distinct class. It is commonly used for testing and illustrating clustering and classification algorithms,\n",
    "particularly those designed to handle non-linearly separable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Local outliers are data points that are considered anomalous within a local neighborhood but may not be outliers in the\n",
    "global context of the dataset. Global outliers, on the other hand, are anomalies that deviate significantly from the overall\n",
    "distribution of the data and are considered outliers across the entire dataset. Local outliers are sensitive to local variations\n",
    "in data density, while global outliers exhibit exceptional behavior relative to the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Local outliers can be detected using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm, which measures the local density deviation\n",
    "of a data point relative to its neighbors. Points with significantly lower density compared to their neighbors are considered\n",
    "local outliers, indicating that they are less densely surrounded and potentially anomalous within their local neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Global outliers can be detected using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which isolates anomalies by recursively partitioning\n",
    "the feature space using random splits until each data point is isolated. Anomalies are identified as data points that require \n",
    "fewer splits to isolate, indicating that they are less likely to be part of the majority of the data and are thus considered\n",
    "global outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. In real-world applications where local outlier detection is more appropriate, anomalies are expected to occur within\n",
    "specific localized regions or clusters, and detecting deviations from local norms is essential. Examples include detecting\n",
    "anomalies in localized sensor networks, detecting fraudulent activities in localized transaction data, or identifying outliers\n",
    "in specific geographical regions. Conversely, in scenarios where global outlier detection is required, anomalies are expected\n",
    "to deviate from the overall distribution of the data and may not be confined to specific regions or clusters. Examples include\n",
    "detecting outliers in large-scale financial transactions, identifying rare events in global health data, or detecting anomalies\n",
