    "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the \n",
    "other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: It is a type of categorical encoding where categories are assigned ordinal integers based on the order or\n",
    "    rank of the categories. The assigned integers have a meaningful relationship reflecting the order of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Education levels - \"High School\" (1), \"Bachelor's\" (2), \"Master's\" (3), \"PhD\" (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: It is a more general categorical encoding technique where each category is assigned a unique integer label\n",
    "    without any inherent order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Colors - \"Red\" (1), \"Green\" (2), \"Blue\" (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Ordinal Encoding when the categorical variable has a clear order or hierarchy, and preserving that order is important for the model.\n",
    "Use Label Encoding when there is no intrinsic order among the categories, and the model does not need to learn any ordinal relationships.\n",
    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, categories are encoded based on their relationship with the target variable. It considers the mean of the target variable for each category and assigns ordinal labels accordingly.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a customer churn prediction project, you might use target guided ordinal encoding for a categorical variable like \"Customer Satisfaction.\" You encode categories based on the average churn rate within each category. Categories with higher average churn rates get higher ordinal labels, indicating a stronger association with churn.\n",
    "Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree of joint variability between two random variables. It indicates whether an increase in one\n",
    "variable is associated with an increase or decrease in another.\n",
    "Importance in Statistical Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance helps understand the direction of the relationship between variables. A positive covariance suggests a \n",
    "direct relationship, while a negative covariance suggests an inverse relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample dataset\n",
    "data = {'Color': ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'red', 'blue'],\n",
    "        'Size': ['small', 'medium', 'large', 'small', 'medium'],\n",
    "        'Material': ['wood', 'metal', 'plastic', 'metal', 'wood']}\n",

    "# Create a DataFrame\n",

    "Q5. Calculate the covariance matrix for the following variables in a dataset: Age, Income, and Education level. Interpret \n",
    "    the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance matrix is a symmetric matrix that shows the covariances between all pairs of variables. \n",
    "Let's denote the matrix as \n",
    "  \n",

    "Cov(Age,Education)\n",
    "Cov(Income,Education)\n",
    "Cov(Education,Education)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The diagonal elements represent the variances of individual variables.\n",
    "Off-diagonal elements represent the covariances between pairs of variables.\n",
    "A positive covariance indicates a positive relationship, and a negative covariance indicates a negative relationship.\n",
    "Q6. You are working on a machine learning project with a dataset containing several categorical variables, including \"Gender\"\n",
    "(Male/Female), \"Education Level\" (High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD), and \"Employment Status\" (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time).\n",
    "Which encoding method would you use for each variable, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender (Binary): Use Label Encoding since there are only two categories (Male and Female).\n",
    "\n",
    "Education Level (Ordinal): Use Ordinal Encoding since there is a clear order or hierarchy among the education levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employment Status (Nominal): Use Nominal Encoding since there is no inherent order among the employment statuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. You are analyzing a dataset with two continuous variables, \"Temperature\" and \"Humidity\", and two categorical variables,\n",
    "\"Weather Condition\" (Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy) and \"Wind Direction\" (North/South/East/West). Calculate the covariance between each \n",
    "pair of variables and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance between two continuous variables (Temperature and Humidity) can indicate whether they tend to increase or decrease\n",
    "together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance between a continuous variable and a categorical variable (e.g., Temperature and Weather Condition) provides insight\n",
    "into how the categorical variable changes concerning the continuous variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance between two categorical variables (Weather Condition and Wind Direction) is not meaningful because categorica\n",
    "l variables are not assumed to have a numerical relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation should be done cautiously, and correlation (normalized covariance) is often used for better comparison across\n",
    "different scales. Positive covariance suggests a positive relationship, and negative covariance suggests an inverse\n",
