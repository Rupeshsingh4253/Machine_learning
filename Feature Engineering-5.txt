Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.

Interpretation:
If 
r is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship, meaning that as the time spent studying increases, final exam scores also increase.
If 
r is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship, meaning that as the time spent studying increases, final exam scores decrease.
If 
r is close to 0, it suggests a weak or no linear relationship between the two variables.
Q2. Spearman's rank correlation is a measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables. Suppose you have collected data on the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 10. Calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between these two variables and interpret the result.

Spearman's rank correlation (
ρ) is calculated by first ranking the data and then calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient on the ranks.

Interpretation
If 
ρ is close to 1, it indicates a strong monotonic positive relationship, meaning that as the amount of sleep increases, job satisfaction also tends to increase.
If
ρ is close to -1, it indicates a strong monotonic negative relationship, meaning that as the amount of sleep increases, job satisfaction tends to decrease.
If 
ρ is close to 0, it suggests a weak or no monotonic relationship between the two variables.
Q3. Suppose you are conducting a study to examine the relationship between the number of hours of exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) in a sample of adults. You collected data on both variables for 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation between these two variables and compare the results.

Pearson correlation coefficient (
r): Measures the linear relationship.
Spearman's rank correlation (
ρ): Measures the monotonic relationship.

Comparison:

If the relationship is approximately linear, Pearson correlation (
r) may be more appropriate.
If the relationship is monotonic but not necessarily linear, Spearman's rank correlation (
ρ) is suitable.
Calculate both coefficients and interpret the results accordingly.

Q4. A researcher is interested in examining the relationship between the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity. The researcher collected data on both variables from a sample of 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables.

Interpretation:

If 
r is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship, meaning that as the hours of watching TV increase, the level of physical activity also tends to increase.
If 
r is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship, meaning that as the hours of watching TV increase, the level of physical activity tends to decrease.
If 
r is close to 0, it suggests a weak or no linear relationship between the two variables.
