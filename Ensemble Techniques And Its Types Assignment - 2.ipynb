    "Q1. Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by creating multiple trees trained on different bootstrap samples of\n",
    "the original training data.\n",
    "Since each tree in the ensemble is trained on a subset of the data, they capture different aspects of the underlying \n",
    "patterns in the data. When making predictions, bagging averages the predictions from all the trees, which helps to smooth \n",

    "improve the generalization performance of the model and reduces overfitting.\n",

    "Q2. Advantages of using different types of base learners in bagging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased diversity: Different base learners may capture different aspects of the underlying data distribution, leading to\n",
    "a more diverse ensemble.\n",
    "Robustness: Using diverse base learners can improve the robustness of the ensemble to noise and outliers in the data.\n",
    "Disadvantages of using different types of base learners:\n",
    "Complexity: Managing and combining predictions from different types of base learners can increase the complexity of the ensemble.\n",
    "Computational cost: Training and combining predictions from diverse base learners may require more computational resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q3. The choice of base learner affects the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging. Using complex base learners with high variance\n",
    "(e.g., deep decision trees) tends to reduce bias but may increase variance in the ensemble. On the other hand, using simpler\n",
    "base learners with low variance (e.g., shallow decision trees) may decrease variance but increase bias. By averaging\n",
    "predictions from multiple base learners trained on different subsets of the data, bagging reduces variance without\n",
    "significantly increasing bias, thereby improving the overall model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Yes, bagging can be used for both classification and regression tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification tasks, bagging involves training multiple classifiers (e.g., decision trees) on different bootstrap samples \n",
    "of the training data and combining their predictions using voting or averaging.\n",
    "In regression tasks, bagging similarly trains multiple regression models (e.g., decision trees) on different bootstrap \n",
    "samples of the training data and combines their predictions using averaging.\n",
    "The main difference lies in how the predictions are combined: classification tasks typically use voting to determine the final\n",
    "    class label, while regression tasks use averaging to estimate the final numeric value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The ensemble size in bagging refers to the number of base learners (e.g., decision trees) included in the ensemble.\n",
    "Increasing the ensemble size generally improves the performance of bagging by reducing variance and stabilizing predictions.\n",
    "However, there is a point of diminishing returns, where adding more models does not lead to significant improvements in \n",
    "performance but increases computational cost. The optimal ensemble size depends on factors such as the complexity of the \n",
    "problem, the size of the dataset, and computational resources. Empirical studies and cross-validation can help determine the\n",
    "appropriate ensemble size for a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. A real-world application of bagging in machine learning is in the field of finance for stock market prediction. In this \n",
    "application, multiple predictive models (e.g., decision trees, neural networks) are trained on historical stock market data, \n",
    "each capturing different patterns or trends in the market. By aggregating predictions from multiple models using bagging, the \n",
