    "Q1. Ridge Regression vs. Ordinary Least Squares Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a regularized linear regression technique that adds a penalty term based on the sum of squared coefficients to the ordinary least squares (OLS) cost function.\n",
    "OLS aims to minimize the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values, while Ridge also penalizes large coefficients.\n",
    "Ridge is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity, as it helps prevent overfitting by reducing the impact of correlated predictors.\n",
    "Q2. Assumptions of Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to ordinary least squares regression, Ridge Regression assumes linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.\n",
    "Ridge Regression is more robust to violations of the assumption of multicollinearity.\n",
    "Q3. Selecting the Tuning Parameter (Lambda) in Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuning parameter, denoted as \n",
    "λ, controls the strength of the regularization.\n",
    "Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, can be employed to find the optimal \n",
    "λ that minimizes prediction error.\n",
    "The \n",
    "λ value that results in the lowest cross-validated error is typically chosen.\n",
    "Q4. Ridge Regression for Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression does not perform variable selection in the same way as Lasso, which can lead to exactly zero coefficients.\n",
    "However, Ridge tends to shrink coefficients towards zero, effectively downweighting less important features. It does not eliminate them entirely.\n",
    "Q5. Performance of Ridge Regression in Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is designed to handle multicollinearity effectively.\n",
    "It works well when predictors are highly correlated because it mitigates the problem of inflated standard errors and unstable coefficients.\n",
    "Q6. Handling Categorical and Continuous Variables in Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous independent variables.\n",
    "For categorical variables, they are typically encoded using methods like one-hot encoding before applying Ridge Regression.\n",
    "Q7. Interpreting Coefficients in Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge coefficients are interpreted similarly to those in ordinary least squares regression, but the penalty term affects the size of the coefficients.\n",
    "The larger the \n",
    "λ, the more the coefficients are shrunk towards zero.\n",
    "Q8. Ridge Regression for Time-Series Data Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression can be used for time-series data, especially when dealing with multicollinearity.\n",
    "It is important to consider the temporal structure of the data and potentially use lagged variables if applicable.\n",
    "The choice of the regularization parameter \n",
    "λ can be determined through cross-validation."
