    "Q1. Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on the value\n",
    "    of a particular feature, each branch represents the outcome of the decision, and each leaf node represents the class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Choose the feature that best splits the data into subsets based on a criterion\n",
    "(e.g., Gini impurity or entropy).\n",
    "Recursive Splitting: Recursively apply the feature selection process to each subset, creating a tree structure.\n",
    "Stopping Criteria: Define stopping criteria to halt the recursion, such as reaching a maximum depth or a minimum number of\n",
    "samples in a node.\n",
    "Predictions: Assign the majority class of the instances in a leaf node to that leaf node, making predictions based on the \n",
    "decision path.\n",
    "Q2. Mathematical Intuition behind Decision Tree Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting Criterion (Gini Impurity):\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given node, calculate the Gini impurity\n",
    "A lower impurity indicates a better split.\n",
    "Information Gain (Entropy):\n",
    "\n",
    "For each split, calculate the information gain based on the entropy of the subsets.\n",
    "Information gain measures the reduction in uncertainty after a split.\n",
    "Q3. Binary Classification with Decision Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Predict whether an instance belongs to class 0 or class 1.\n",
    "Leaf Nodes: Represent the predicted class (0 or 1) based on majority voting.\n",
    "Q4. Geometric Intuition behind Decision Tree Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Boundaries: Decision trees create axis-parallel decision boundaries in the feature space.\n",
    "Splitting: Each split divides the space into regions, and the final regions correspond to the leaves of the tree.\n",
    "Q5. Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: A confusion matrix is a table that describes the performance of a classification model.\n",
    "Components:\n",
    "True Positive (TP): Correctly predicted positive instances.\n",
    "True Negative (TN): Correctly predicted negative instances.\n",
    "False Positive (FP): Incorrectly predicted as positive.\n",
    "False Negative (FN): Incorrectly predicted as negative.\n",
    "Q6. Example of a Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "vbnet\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "                 Actual Class 0     Actual Class 1\n",
    "Predicted Class 0       TN                 FP\n",
    "Predicted Class 1       FN                 TP\n",
    " \n",
    "Q7. Choosing an Appropriate Evaluation Metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consideration Factors:\n",
    "Class Imbalance: For imbalanced datasets, accuracy might be misleading, and precision, recall, or F1 score may be more \n",
    "    informative.\n",
    "Business Objectives: Prioritize metrics based on the consequences of different types of errors in the context of the \n",
    "    application.\n",
    "Q8. Example where Precision is Important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario: Fraud Detection\n",
    "Reason: In fraud detection, it's crucial to minimize false positives (predicting normal transactions as fraud), as this might \n",
    "inconvenience users. High precision helps achieve this goal.\n",
    "Q9. Example where Recall is Important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario: Medical Diagnosis (Cancer Detection)\n",
    "Reason: In medical diagnosis, it's important to minimize false negatives (missing actual cases of disease), as this could have\n",
    "severe consequences. High recall helps ensure that most positive instances are captured."
