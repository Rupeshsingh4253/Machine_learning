    "Q1: Key Features of the Wine Quality Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The wine quality data set typically includes features such as:\n",
    "Fixed acidity\n",
    "Volatile acidity\n",
    "Citric acid\n",
    "Residual sugar\n",
    "Chlorides\n",
    "Free sulfur dioxide\n",
    "Total sulfur dioxide\n",
    "Density\n",
    "pH\n",
    "Sulphates\n",
    "Alcohol\n",
    "The importance of each feature in predicting wine quality depends on the specific characteristics of the wine.\n",
    "For example, acidity levels, alcohol content, and sulfur dioxide concentrations may play significant roles.\n",
    "Analyzing feature importance through techniques like feature importance plots or model interpretation methods\n",
    "can provide insights into which features contribute the most to predicting wine quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Handling Missing Data in the Wine Quality Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Different imputation techniques can be used for handling missing data, such as mean or median imputation, forward o\n",
    "r backward filling, or advanced techniques like multiple imputation. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages\n",
    ". Mean or median imputation is simple but may distort the data distribution. Multiple imputation provides more accurate\n",
    "results but can be computationally intensive.\n",
    "Q3: Factors Affecting Students' Performance in Exams\n",
    "\n",
    "Key factors affecting students' performance may include:\n",
    "Study time\n",
    "Attendance\n",
    "Prior academic performance\n",
    "Socioeconomic status\n",
    "Motivation\n",
    "Learning style\n",
    "Analyzing these factors involves statistical techniques such as regression analysis, correlation, and hypothesis testing to\n",
    "identify significant predictors of exam performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Feature Engineering in Student Performance Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones. For student performance, this might involve\n",
    "combining variables, creating interaction terms, or encoding categorical variables. Selection could be based on domain \n",
    "knowledge, exploratory data analysis, or feature importance from models.\n",
    "Q5: EDA on Wine Quality Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis involves analyzing distributions of features. Features exhibiting non-normality can be identified\n",
    "using histograms or statistical tests. Transformations like log transformations or Box-Cox transformations can be applied to\n",
    "improve normality.\n",
    "Q6: PCA on Wine Quality Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce dimensionality. The minimum number of principal components required\n",
    "to explain 90% of the variance can be determined by examining the cumulative explained variance plot. The point where the curve\n",
    "reaches or exceeds 90% gives the minimum number of principal components needed."
