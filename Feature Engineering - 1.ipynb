    "Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method is a feature selection technique that assesses the relevance of features based on their statistical \n",
    "properties. It does not involve training a machine learning model. Instead, it relies on statistical measures, such as\n",
    "correlation, mutual information, chi-squared test, or information gain, to evaluate the importance of each feature\n",
    "independently. Features are then ranked or selected based on these measures, and a subset of the most relevant features\n",
    "is chosen for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wrapper method involves training a machine learning model using different subsets of features and evaluating their\n",
    "performance. It employs a search algorithm, such as forward selection, backward elimination, or recursive feature elimination,\n",
    "to iteratively build and assess feature subsets. The performance of the model is used as a criterion to select the best subset\n",
    "of features. Unlike the Filter method, the Wrapper method considers the interaction between features and their impact on the\n",
    "model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded feature selection methods incorporate feature selection as an integral part of the model training process. Some common\n",
    "techniques include:\n",
    "Lasso Regression (L1 regularization): It penalizes the absolute values of the coefficients during model training, encouraging\n",
    "sparsity and effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "Decision Trees and Random Forests: These algorithms can inherently perform feature selection by giving importance scores to \n",
    "features based on their contribution to the decision-making process.\n",
    "Gradient Boosted Trees: Similar to random forests, gradient boosting algorithms assign importance scores to features, allowing\n",
    "for implicit feature selection.\n",
    "Elastic Net: A combination of L1 and L2 regularization, which combines the sparsity-inducing property of L1 with the\n",
    "regularization strength of L2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are some drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection?\n",
    "Independence Assumption: The Filter method evaluates features independently, which may overlook interactions or dependencies\n",
    "between features.\n",
    "Limited to Statistical Measures: It relies solely on statistical measures and may not capture complex relationships present in\n",
    "the data.\n",
    "Inability to Incorporate Model Feedback: Filter methods do not take into account the impact of feature selection on the \n",
    "performance of a specific machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In which situations would you prefer using the Filter method over the Wrapper method for feature selection?\n",
    "The choice between Filter and Wrapper methods depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand.\n",
    "Use the Filter method when:\n",
    "Large Feature Space: Filter methods are computationally less intensive and can handle large feature spaces more efficiently \n",
    "than Wrapper methods.\n",
    "Independence of Features: If features are largely independent, or if the goal is to quickly identify potentially relevant\n",
    "features without considering their interactions, the Filter method may be more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
